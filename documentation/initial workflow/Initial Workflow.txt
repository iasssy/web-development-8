PLANNING AND PREPARATION 

# Planning, steps performed 

Our plan includes to choose the optimal design comprising essential features like user registration and task management. The webpages to be created are:  

  * Home page 
  * User log in 
  * Users sign up 
  * Dashboard to manage user profile and tasks 
  * Page or modal showing a single task to be created or updated 
  * Contact us page 

We need to enable PHP session when user logs in. And when session is created, user can  

  * Manage own profile  
  * Delete their account  
  * View the listing of to-do items 
  * Adding new to-do item 
  * Updating items  
  * Removing items  
  * Completing item 

 

# Data Model  

  Users: Can create multiple tasks, each associated with only one user. 
  Tasks: Belong to one list. 
  Lists: Can have multiple tasks. 
  Reminders: Each task can have one reminder. 
 

  EXTRA possible features for future development: 
  Tags: Associated with one or multiple tasks. 
  Task Collaborators: Enables multiple users to collaborate on a single task.

 

Database structure in Third normal form (3NF): 

users = (id (PK), username, password, avatar_image, email) 

tasks = (id (PK), name, description, task_order, user_id (FK), list_id (FK), due_date, completed)  

lists = (id (PK), name, list_color) 

reminders = (id (PK), task_id (FK), reminder_time, repeat_interval, repeat_end_date)  

 

Extra tables for future development (if time allows): 

tags = (id (PK), name, tag_color) 
task_tags = (task_id (FK), tag_id (FK)) 
task_collaborators = (id (PK), task_id (FK), user_id (FK)) 

Additional possible features:  
Task to be “important”
