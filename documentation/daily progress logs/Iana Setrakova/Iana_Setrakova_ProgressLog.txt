Errors not fixed:
    - For some reason, when the user is a new one, having no lists, a new list is not created
    - For the logged user, if the list has no tasks, the quick statistics panel is not not present, 
        and the jquery of updating it (updateQuickStats) is still performed. 
        I tried to add it (having "0"), but couldn't for some reason. That's why the Console shows jquery errors.
    - gitignore seems not working
    - For some reason, if I use Fat-Free syntax in "tasks/edit-task.html", this form stops working, had to use simple PHP


Features that will be implemented in future:
    - checkbox "Remember me" functionality in both log in and sign up
    - user profile modification (username and avatar)
    - list order implementation
    - due date wasn't worked with
